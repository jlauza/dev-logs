# 🖋️ Dev Logs: Tactical Postmortems from the Codefront

Welcome to the war journal.

This repository holds postmortems, tech autopsies, and battle-tested lessons from real-world development projects.  
Each folder is a campaign, each file a mission log. Mistakes were made. Solutions were found.  
Blood, sweat, and semicolons were spilled.

## 🎯 Purpose

To **document**, **share**, and **reflect** on the coding chaos.  
Sometimes things go right. Usually they don't.  
This is where we dissect why — and how we fixed it.

## 🗂️ Projects

Each project has its own folder with logs named by date and operation.

| Folder        | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `pro-dance-x` | Full-stack monorepo (Next.js + Fastify + MongoDB) |
| `steroidphp`  | Legacy PHP beast on performance-enhancing drugs   |
| `dashme`      | A dashboard experiment turned full-blown warzone  |

## 📜 Format

Logs use Markdown and start with a frontmatter block like this:

```md
---
title: "Operation: Fastify Port Liberation"
date: 2025-07-23
project: Pro Dance Suite X
tags: [docker, fastify, backend, monorepo-conflict, port-war]
---

Then comes the story: setup, pain, fix, and lessons. Written with honesty and a dash of sarcasm.

## 🛡️ Why This Exists

- So future-me doesn’t fight the same war twice.
- So maybe you don’t have to either.
- Because documentation doesn’t have to be boring.
```

## ⚔️ Contributing

- Not currently accepting external postmortems — this is an internal archive.
- But feel free to fork, read, adapt, or shout into the void.
