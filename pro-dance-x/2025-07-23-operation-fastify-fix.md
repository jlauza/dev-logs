## 🧊 Cold Comm Protocol Breach: Fastify Isolated

## The Standoff: “The Radio Says Clear But The Area Is Still Chaos.”

The logs claimed victory:

> **Fastify operational. Port secured.**  
> Meanwhile, recon from the browser frontlines screamed:  
> “Connection refused. Page isn’t working.”

The backend was inside a Docker-controlled zone. A perfectly good Fastify instance, armed and ready. But our browser? No comms. Total blackout. Outside the fences.

Like shouting across a demilitarized zone with a banana for a radio.

---

## Recon Report

- Fastify was broadcasting from its **default internal port**.
- Docker’s port mapping was **a misfire** — translating wrong coordinates to the external world.
- Command mistakenly issued a same-same mapping (`{custom}:{custom}`), assuming backend compliance.
- Fastify, of course, stayed on its own post, unaware of the diplomatic blunder.

---

## The Strategic Adjustment: Correct the Map

The fix was pure logistics.

Docker doesn’t guess your intentions — it just routes traffic based on the map you draw.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
ports:
  - "<external-port>:<fastify-internal-port>"
```

Once HQ aligned the Fastify default post with Docker’s port mapping, the line lit up. Clean signal. Browser forces made contact.

## Outcome of Operation: BACKEND-HAIL

- Fastify finally answered the call ✅
- Mapped ports correctly, respecting chain of command ✅
- No exposed internal ports — radio silence for enemy eyes ✅
- Browser got its intel. Mission success. ✅
- Lesson learned: Docker isn’t psychic, it’s literal. Bring your own map. ✅

**Backend is operational.** No error signals. No success confirmation either.
Too quiet. Suspiciously quiet.
We're keeping watch.

**End of log.**
