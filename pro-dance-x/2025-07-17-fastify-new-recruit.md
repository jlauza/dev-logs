## The Arrival

Brought in a backend to the family. Welcome, Fastify — the troublesome recruit of the monorepo clan.

Expected obedience. Got rebellion.

It just... wouldn’t start. Refused to behave.

---

## Fix & Result

Turns out it wasn’t Fastify’s fault.  
Just needed a gentle but firm slap from `ts-node`.

No build. No transpile. Just:

```bash
npm run dev
# with: "dev": "ts-node index.ts"
```

## What I did:

- Set up ts-node for direct TypeScript execution
- Gave it its own tsconfig.json
- Assigned port 8000 because 3000 was already full of attitude

## The Outcome:

- Fastify started running
- Behaving. Logging like a real app
- Welcome to the family, backend menace

**End of Log.**
